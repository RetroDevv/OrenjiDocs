Please make sure that your custom prefix is indeed configured correctly before you wonder why all of your commands have suddenly stopped working. This bot is being actively developed solely, command errors will not be fixed instantly if it is an issue on my part.

It can be reproduced by doing one of the developer commands, which you shouldn't know. \"That command doesn't exist!\" error This error is flagged when you provide the set prefix with a word or phrase that isn't a command. It can be reproduced by putting your current set prefix followed by literally anything that isn't a command. \"Please pass in all required arguments for this command!\" error This error is flagged when you don't provide the required arguments for a command. For example the +changeprefix command will spit out this error if no prefix is provided after the command. It can be reproduced by doing a command that requires some argument to function and not passing in any arguments. \"This command is on cooldown for another amount seconds!\" error Another self explanitory one, the command you're trying to do is rate limiting you.
